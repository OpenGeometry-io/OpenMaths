## Rust vs C++
- I have came to a conclusion that I need a robust math library for the Kernel Operations
- When I went to look for how these Math Libraries are structured, I found that the best solution these day is to use Native Code + WebAssembly.
- But I struggled to decide, with so many options, two langauges are mentioned the most `C++` and `Rust`
- I'm no where a expert what is best, and then I thought why not create a package using both? 
- This is not going to hurt me, surely I will have to invest double time, but I'm confident that this learning wouldn't go away!
